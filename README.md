# MicroPaper

## Project Overview

MicroPaper is a cryptocurrency project focused on democratizing access to Commercial Paper for Small to Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs). By leveraging blockchain technology, MicroPaper aims to create a more accessible and transparent marketplace for commercial paper trading, enabling SMBs to access short-term funding solutions that were previously limited to larger corporations.

## Mission

To bridge the gap between traditional commercial paper markets and small to medium-sized businesses by providing:
- **Accessibility**: Lower barriers to entry for SMBs
- **Transparency**: Blockchain-based transparency in commercial paper transactions
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined processes for both issuers and investors
- **Security**: Smart contract-based security and compliance

## Current Status: MVP Development

This repository is currently in the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** development phase. The MVP will focus on core functionality to validate the concept and gather initial user feedback.
